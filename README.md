This repository contains the notebooks I created while working through Deep Learning Prerequisites from Udemy. My full reviews of the courses are available on my website:

 - [Numpy Stack](http://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html?utm_campaign=course-reviews&utm_medium=website&utm_source=github)
 - [Linear and Logistic Regression](http://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-linear-logistic-regression.html?utm_campaign=course-reviews&utm_medium=website&utm_source=github)

To complete all of the notebooks you need to install a few packages:

    - numpy
	- pandas
	- matplotlib
	- scipy
