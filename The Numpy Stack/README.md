This repository contains the notebooks I created while working through [Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python](https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/learn/v4/content) from Udemy. My full review of the course is available on my [website](http://andrewwegner.com/deep-learning-prereq-numpy.html?utm_campaign=course-reviews&utm_medium=website&utm_source=github). 

To complete all of the notebooks you need to install a few packages:

    - numpy
	- pandas
	- matplotlib
	- scipy
